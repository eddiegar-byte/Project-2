      <h4>Igneous</h4>
      <h4>Metamorphic</h4>
      <h4>Sedimentary</h4>
      <p>Igneous rocks form when molten rock—called magma beneath the surface or lava above—cools and hardens. If it cools 
         slowly underground, like granite, the rock known as an intrusive igneous rock and develops large, visible crystals. 
         If it cools quickly on the surface, like basalt or obsidian, it forms a smoother texture with smaller or no crystals
         and is called extrusive igneous rock. These rocks are the foundations of Earth’s crust and often mark areas of past 
         volcanic activity.</p>
      <p>Metamorphic rocks start as igneous or sedimentary rocks but are changed by intense heat and pressure beneath Earth’s 
         surface. This process alters their structure, texture, and even mineral makeup without melting them. Common metamorphic 
         rocks include slate, marble, gneiss, and schist. These rocks often have wavy or banded layers and can be very strong and 
         beautiful, making them popular in art and architecture.</p>
      <p>Sedimentary rocks are created from layers of broken-down material like sand, mud, and small bits of other rocks. Over time, 
         these layers are compressed and cemented together, usually in lakes, rivers, or oceans. Rocks like limestone, shale, and 
         sandstone fall into this category. They often contain fossils and provide clues about Earth’s past environments and ancient 
         life</p>

   <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Eclogite, a rare metamorphic rock, forms deep within the Earth's mantle, over 30 miles 
      below the surface, and can contain tiny crystals of garnet and jadeite. Eclogite is so dense and heavy that it 
      actually helps scientists understand how continents shift and sink over geologic time.</p>
