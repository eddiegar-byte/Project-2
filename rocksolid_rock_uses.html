        <strong>Rocks have been used in construction for thousands of years in case you didn't notice.</strong> 
        Anything from ancient pyramids to modern skyscrapers are a result of rock and human ingenuity. Durable rocks like 
        granite, limestone, and sandstone are commonly used for buildings, bridges, and monuments because they can 
        withstand weather and heavy loads. Crushed stone from quarries is also a major component in concrete and asphalt, 
        forming the foundation of roads, sidewalks, and homes.

        <strong>Some rocks are of course essential in producing energy and industrial materials.</strong> Coal, a 
        sedimentary rock, has long been used as a fuel source for electricity and heating. Certain metamorphic and igneous 
        rocks contain valuable minerals like uranium (used in nuclear energy), graphite (used in batteries and lubricants), 
        and bauxite (the source of aluminum). These resources are extracted through mining and play a key role in powering modern life.

      aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="collapseThree">
        3. Art, Decoration, & Everyday Objects.

        <strong>We also use rocks in our arts, decor, and everyday life as they not only have their myriad utilitarian uses, 
        but they can also be beautiful and symbolic. </strong> Marble and alabaster have been used for centuries in sculptures 
        and decorative architecture due to their smooth texture and ability to hold fine detail. Semi-precious stones like jade, 
        ruby, turquoise, and sapphire are cut and polished into jewelry, beads, and ornaments. Even chalk, a soft rock made of 
        microscopic fossils, is used for writing, drawing, and sports.

<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Some ancient cultures used rocks as early forms of currency. Large, doughnut-shaped limestone disks 
   called Rai stones were used on the island of Yap in Micronesia as money. These massive stones, sometimes taller than a person, 
   were so valuable that their ownership could change hands without ever moving the stone itself.</p>
